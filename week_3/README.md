# 🧮 Discount Price Calculator - README

## 📋 Overview

This Python program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount, but only if the discount percentage is 20% or higher. The program demonstrates good coding practices including input validation, modular design, and user-friendly output formatting.

## ✨ Features

- **💡 Intelligent Discount Calculation:** Automatically applies discounts only when they meet the 20% threshold.
- **🔒 Robust Input Handling:** Validates all user input to prevent errors.
- **🖥️ Detailed Output:** Presents results in a clean, formatted display.
- **📢 Helpful Feedback:** Provides additional information when discounts aren't applied.
- **🧩 Modular Design:** Organized into reusable functions for maintainability.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.x

## 🚀 How to Use
